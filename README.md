## Mars Rover Kata

##### Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid:

1. The rover has a starting point (x,y) and a direction (N,S,E,W) property
which describe the initial position and facing direction.

2. The rover receives commands as a character array.

3. Implement the rover functionality that moves the rover forward (M).

4. Implement the rover functionality that turns the rover left/right (L,R).

5. Implement wrapping from one side of the grid to another.

6. Implement the functionality in a test-driven manner. (MarsRover.spec.js)
